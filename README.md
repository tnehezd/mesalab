# About `mesalab` pipeline

> ⚠️**NOTE:** This project is currently under active development. Features and APIs may change, and new functionalities are continuously being added.

The Python package `mesalab` is designed for **processing and analyzing stellar evolution simulations performed with**  [MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/) (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). It is developed to efficiently handle **large grids of simulations**, such as those where stellar mass (M) and metallicity (Z) are systematically varied.

The primary goal of this pipeline is to take your MESA outputs and automatically:

1.  Analyze each simulation within your grid.
2.  Identify if the star enters the *blue loop* phase and crosses the instability strip.
3.  Based on these findings, prepare [GYRE](https://gyre.readthedocs.io/) input files and run the corresponding pulsation simulations.

## Installation

### Install from pip

To install `mesalab` with pip:

```console
$ pip install mesalab
```
----

Building from Source (Recommended for Developers)

For scientific packages with complex dependencies like mesalab, we highly recommend using a conda environment to build from source. This ensures all binary dependencies are handled correctly, avoiding common compiler errors.

Step 1: Set up the conda environment
Create a dedicated environment with all the necessary scientific packages. The conda-forge channel is required for some dependencies.
```console
$ conda create --name mesalab_env python=3.9
$ conda activate mesalab_env
$ conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas matplotlib scipy pyyaml tqdm numba swifter dask pyarrow h5py astropy
```

Step 2: Install mesalab from source
Clone the repository and install the project in "editable" mode.
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/konkolyseismolab/mesalab
$ cd mesalab
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

To get started, you'll need to prepare a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) that specifies your MESA input directories, output locations, and analysis preferences.

You can run `mesalab` by providing your configuration file:

```console
$ mesalab --config myconfig.yaml
```

For a full list of command-line arguments and their descriptions, use the help command:

```console
$ mesalab --help
```

For more detailed information on configuration options, command-line arguments, and advanced usage, please consult the official `mesalab` documentation on [Read the Docs](https://mesalab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
